About the Project

While writing an academic paper, I realized how useful it would be to have a system that could automatically detect incorrect or misattributed quotes in my text. This project is designed to help identify such issues by extracting quotes from a document and verifying them against reliable sources.

Features
 • Automatically extracts quotes from a given text
 • Searches for the quotes in Wikipedia, Google Scholar, and other reliable sources
 • Compares the extracted quotes with online references to check for accuracy
 • Provides a report indicating which quotes are verified and which might be inaccurate

How to Run the Project
 1. Install the required Python libraries:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4


 2. Run the script:

python quote_checker.py



Future Improvements
 • Expanding the list of reliable sources for verification
 • Enhancing accuracy in detecting misattributed quotes
 • Adding an offline mode with a built-in database of verified quotes

If you have any suggestions or ideas for improvement, feel free to contribute or open an issue in the repository.
